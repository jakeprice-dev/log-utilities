## Personal Log Utilities

A collection of personal Python scripts for enabling features on my Personal Log.

To clarify the "log" here is not related to system logs, it's the name I've given my personal journal/knowledge base/organisation tool that I have created for my own personal usage.

- `todo_summary.py` - Send a summary of current log entries marked as `type: todo-[p/1/2/3]` to Telegram

## Configuration

Configuration and secret variables are stored in `config.yml` and _not_ committed to the repository. `config_template.yml` can be used as a template for a `config.yml` file.
